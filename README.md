In this notebook, you will  practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.


Below, is where we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics learned in the course.

We will use some of the algorithms taught in the course, specifically:

1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN
3. SVM
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. XGBoost

We will evaluate our models using:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Precision
3.  Recall
4.  f1_score
